    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is an example web page created as part of a GUI assignment. Here, we explore various HTML and CSS properties to build a non-trivial website that incorporates headings, paragraphs, images, tables, and more. This page is designed to showcase basic web development skills and is aimed at making the content look organized and visually appealing.</p>

    <h2>About This Assignment</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to help students practice web development fundamentals. By incorporating various elements such as tables, images, links, and text styling, students can learn how to structure web content effectively. The following sections will demonstrate some of these features in action.</p>

    <h2>Useful Links</h2>
    <p>Here are some useful resources to help you learn more about HTML and CSS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML Documentation - MDN</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS Documentation - MDN</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Table Example</h2>
    <p>Tables are a great way to organize data. Below is an example of a table that displays some data in a clear and structured way:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Quantity</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Apples</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>$2.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bananas</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>$1.50</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Oranges</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>$3.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>HTML entities are special characters that can be used in HTML. For example, to display an ampersand (&amp;), you would use the entity <code>&amp;amp;</code>. Here are a few more examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Less than: <code>&amp;lt;</code> = &lt;</li>
      <li>Greater than: <code>&amp;gt;</code> = &gt;</li>
      <li>Copyright symbol: <code>&amp;copy;</code> = &copy;</li>
      <li>Trademark symbol: <code>&amp;trade;</code> = &trade;</li>
    </ul>
